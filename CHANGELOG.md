# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project
versions the export schema independently via `SCHEMA_VERSION` in
`src/soccer_analysis/export/schema.py`, not just the package version.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- ML-ready data export: versioned pydantic schema (`FrameRecord`/
  `ObjectRecord`/`MatchSummary`), JSONL + Parquet + match-summary + JSON
  Schema writers — the project's core new capability, replacing "annotated
  video only" as the primary output.
- `soccer-analysis` CLI (Typer), `--format` flag selecting any combination
  of `jsonl`/`parquet`/`summary`/`schema`/`video`.
- Installable `src/soccer_analysis` package (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`)
  replacing the original tutorial's flat, `sys.path`-hacked scripts.
- `OnnxDetector`: torch-free default detector backend (onnxruntime), plus
  `UltralyticsDetector` (torch-backed) and `BoTSORTTracker` behind the
  `[train]` extra.
- `PitchKeypointCalibrator`: classical-CV per-frame pitch calibration
  (center-circle + halfway-line detection), an alternative to the static
  per-video `ViewTransformer`. See its docstring for real limitations.
- `EmbeddingTeamClassifier`: small-CNN-embedding team clustering, an
  alternative to raw-pixel-color `TeamAssigner`.
- `Detector`/`PitchCalibrator`/`TeamClassifier`/`FrameTracker` protocols
  (`interfaces.py`, `detection/base.py`) making every stage above swappable
  via `PipelineConfig` without touching `pipeline.py`.
- Test suite (pytest, pure-Python/synthetic-input, no video/model file
  needed), GitHub Actions CI (ruff + mypy + pytest on Python 3.11-3.13),
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- `Dockerfile` for validating the `[train]`-extra-dependent backends on
  platforms (e.g. Intel macOS) where current torch/onnxruntime/boxmot have
  no wheels.
- `scripts/download_assets.py`, `scripts/export_team_embedding_model.py`.
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue/PR
  templates.

### Fixed
Bugs inherited from the original tutorial, found while restructuring and
validating end-to-end against real footage:
- Team-color KMeans clustering was hardcoded to a specific player ID
  (`player_id == 91`) overfit to one video.
- Ball-possession fallback indexed `[-1]` into an empty list on frame 0,
  raising `IndexError` if the ball wasn't assigned to anyone yet.
- `ViewTransformer`'s pixel calibration points and `CameraMovementEstimator`'s
  feature-mask region were hardcoded to one video's resolution/framing.
- `KMeans` calls had no `random_state`, making team clustering
  non-deterministic between runs.
- Track-result caching used `pickle` (unsafe to load from an untrusted
  source); replaced with JSON.
- `interpolate_ball_positions` crashed (`ValueError`) when the ball was
  never detected in any frame of a clip.
- Ball interpolation ran *after* position/camera-compensation/pitch-calibration
  steps instead of before, so an interpolated ball frame never actually got
  those fields computed.
- Team-color seeding assumed frame 0 always has confirmed player tracks;
  false when a tracker's confirmation warm-up delays past frame 0.
- `UltralyticsDetector` and `OnnxDetector` had diverged, inconsistent
  default class-name-to-object-type mappings — running a generic COCO
  checkpoint through `UltralyticsDetector` silently tracked zero players.
- `SpeedDistanceEstimator` divided by zero on the tail window whenever
  `(number_of_frames - 1) % frame_window == 0`.
- `save_video` silently reported success while writing nothing when the
  local OpenCV build lacked a compatible video codec/backend.
- `resolve_device()` unconditionally imported torch, breaking the
  torch-free `OnnxDetector` path even when torch was never needed.

### Changed
- Naming typos throughout (`draw_traingle` → `draw_triangle`,
  `persepctive_trasnformer` → `perspective_transform`,
  `SpeedAndDistance_Estimator` → `SpeedDistanceEstimator`, etc.).
- Notebooks moved to `notebooks/training/` and `notebooks/exploration/`.
- Default video codec changed from XVID/`.avi` to H.264/`.mp4` (more
  broadly supported across OpenCV builds).
